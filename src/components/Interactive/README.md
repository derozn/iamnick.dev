# Interactive

These are the React-Three-Fiber components used to render WebGL components.

## Known issues

Testing is effectively broken due to the nature of `three/examples/jsm/postprocessing` not being a module. See https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/9562
Will investigate more when I get some time.
